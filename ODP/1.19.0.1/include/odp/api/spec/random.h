/**
 * Random kind selector
 *
 * The kind of random denotes the statistical quality of the random data
 * returned. Basic random simply appears uniformly distributed, Cryptographic
 * random is statistically random and suitable for use by cryptographic
 * functions. True random is generated from a hardware entropy source rather
 * than an algorithm and is thus completely unpredictable. These form a
 * hierarchy where higher quality data is presumably more costly to generate
 * than lower quality data.

 * expensive in terms of time to generate, with cryptographic random being
 * something in between. Implementations that support highly efficient true
 * random are free to use this for all requested kinds. So it is always
 * permissible to "upgrade" a random data request, but never to "downgrade"
 * such requests.

 * Generate repeatable random data for testing purposes

 * updated for each call to continue the sequence. Restarting a series of
 * calls with the same initial seed value will generate the same sequence of
 * random test data.

 * This function returns data of ODP_RANDOM_BASIC quality and should be used
 * only for testing purposes. Use odp_random_data() for production.

 *                     call this routine with the same seed variable.
