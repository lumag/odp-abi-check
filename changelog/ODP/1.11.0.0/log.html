<pre class='wrap'>== OpenDataPlane (1.11.0.0)
ODP v1.11.0 is the base tag and branch for the Monarch LTS (Long Term Support)
release of ODP.

=== New Features
==== APIs
As part of the final Monarch LTS API set, a minor change to the
`odp_tm_egress_t` struct was made to better reflect the capabilities of
SoC platforms targeting Monarch support. This change adds the boolean
`egress_fcn_supported` that indicates whether TM  systems support an egress
function. In addition, each TM system is now associated with a PktIO rather
than a PktOUT queue. This struct is input to the `odp_tm_create()` API and
output from the `odp_tm_find()` API.

==== Strict Priority (SP) Scheduler
Building on the modular scheduler framework introduced in v1.10.1.0, An
alternate Strict Priority (SP) scheduler is now available. The SP scheduler
is selected when ODP is configured with the `--enable_schedule_sp` option.

The SP scheduler is designed to favor low-latency processing of high priority
work at the expense of throughput. This is considered experimental code at
this point and should be treated as such by those wishing to use it.

=== Bug Fixes
==== Scheduler PktIO Cleanup
The scheduler now properly cleans up PktIOs operating in SCHEDULE mode following
`odp_pktio_close()` calls. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2301[Bug 2301].

==== Chksum Routine C++ conformance
The odph_chksum() helper routine is now C++ conformant. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2302[Bug 2302].

==== User Area Copying
The `odp_packet_copy()` API now copies the packet user area as part of its
processing and the packet validation test has been enhanced to verify that this
is done properly. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310[Bug 2310].

==== Use of Pool 0 as a Timeout Pool
The internal definition of `ODP_TIMEOUT_INVALID` was changed in `odp-linux` to
enable the use of Pool 0 as a timeout pool. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316[Bug 2316].

=== Packaging
==== libodphelper
To facilitate API tracking, `libodphelper.so` has been split out from
`libodp.so`.

==== Helper dependencies
To avoid circular dependencies that cause issues when packaging ODP as a
shared library, the `odp-linux` implementation no longer makes and use of
the ODP helper library.

=== Performance
Performance enhancements in the `odp-linux` reference implementation have been
made in PktIO routines and the packet classifier.

=== General Cleanup
General cleanup throughout has resulted in adding proper termination calls to
ODP examples as well as miscellaneous Doxygen corrections.  Additionally, the
`odp-linux` code base has been cleaned up by removing "To Dos" as well as
extraneous `#includes` for extra C headers and dependencies on linux headers
for improved portability.

=== Validation
==== Queue Capability Test
The Queue validation test now properly exercises the `odp_queue_capability()`
API and attempts to create the maximum reported number of supported queues.

==== Platform Tests
The platform-specific tests have been moved from `platform/linux-generic/test`
to `test/platform/linux-generc` so that all tests are now found under a
single `test` directory.

=== Examples
The ODP `examples` directory has been cleaned up and numerous corrections to
existing examples have been made to add proper termination paths, etc. In
addition, a new "hello world" example (`odp_hello.c`) has been added that
illustrates the basic startup and shutdown steps needed for all ODP
applications. As a simple stand-alone application is is also a good initial
build tests for new ODP implementations.

=== Documentation
==== Pure API Guide
The Doxygen API guide has been split so that both a "pure" version that is
platform-independent and retains unresolved ODP abstract types as well as
an implementation-specific version (for `odp-linux`) that shows
platform-specific `typedef` and `enum` values.

==== Implementation Guide Improvements
The _ODP Implementer's Guide_ has been enhanced with a section on
implementation considerations, including issues surrounding the definition of
Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs).

=== Known Issues
==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2309[Bug 2309]
The timer validation tests have seen occasional failures when run on systems
containing a larger number of CPUs (typically 24 or more).

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2386[Bug 2386]
ODP cannot be compiled using the -m32 option to generate 32-bit code on a
64-bit platform when using GCC 4.9 (the default GCC found in Ubuntu 15.04).
This is due to a known bug in GCC 4.9 and is closed as a permanent restriction.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2402[Bug 2402]
Doxygen generates a warning for `ODP_BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` when compiling on
little endian systems. A similar warning for `ODP_LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` is
issued when compiling on big endian systems.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2444[Bug 2444]
The traffic manager cannot be used with two PktIOs simultaneously. That is,
`odp-linux` does not properly support applications that create more than one
TM system. This is a bug in the `odp-linux` implementation that will be
corrected. It is not a limit of the architecture or other ODP implementations.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2449[Bug 2449]
Packet queue pool causes out-of-bounds accesses. This is closely related
to https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2444[Bug 2444] and reflects that
`odp-linux` does not properly support multiple TM systems. This is scheduled
for correction in the first maintenance update for this ODP implementation.

== OpenDataPlane (1.10.1.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.10.1.0 is a maintenance release and as such introduces no new APIs or
other changes that might result in application source incompatibility with
v1.10.0.0.

==== Modular Scheduler
The ODP scheduler included as part of the `odp-linux` reference implementation
has been modularized to support a "pluggable" architecture that will permit
the easy introduction of alternate scheduler implementations that permit
both easy experimentation as well as alternate scheduling models that are
tuned to specific application workloads (_i.e.,_ a strict priority scheduler
for latency-sensitive workloads). Included in this release is the just the
foundation and alternate schedulers are expected to be added in future ODP
releases.

=== Packaging

==== Rename of `linux-generic` to `odp-linux`
While the platform name within the ODP git repository remains
`linux-generic`, the package name of this reference implementation has been
changed to `odp-linux` to better reflect that this is an implementation of
ODP that is dependent only on the Linux kernel and is intended to be runnable
on any Linux distribution. All ODP documentation has been changed to reflect
this name change.

=== Helpers

==== Introduction of "agnostic" threading support
The current helper APIs for linux pthreads (`odph_linux_pthread_create()`, etc.)
and processes (`odph_linux_process_fork()`, etc.) have been augmented with a
new "agnostic" set of helper routines for general ODP thread management.

`odph_odpthreads_create()` and `odph_odpthreads_join()` are now the preferred
helpers to use for creating and joining threads that may be implemented as
_either_ pthreads or Linux processes. Although currently ODP threads in
Monarch are assumed to share the same (single) address space, this change is
to permit evolution towards multi-address space (_i.e.,_ process oriented)
threading models without requiring application and/or validation test changes.

The various ODP examples and validation tests that make use of threading have
all been changed to new these new helper APIs.

==== Thread affinity APIs
As part of the new "agnostic" threading support, two additional helper APIs
(`odph_odpthread_getaffinity()` and `odph_odpthread_setaffinity()`) have been
added to permit easy management of thread affinity.

The CUnit framework used by the ODP validation suite has been changed to set
the affinity of the initial thread to the first available control CPU. This
avoids inconsistencies in a number of timing tests.

=== Bug Fixes
As a maintenance release, numerous bugs have been fixed in the `odp-linux`
reference implementation in areas such as platform support (particularly on
32-bit systems), compiler support (clang), C++ compatibility, and other
cleanup items. Highlights include:

==== 32-bit platform support
The `configure` utility now correctly identifies and sets variables needed for
proper compilation on 32-bit x86 systems. In addition the Traffic Manager
now executes properly on 32-bit systems.

==== Timer improvements
The `odp_timer_t` abstract type is now strongly typed for consistency with
other ODP types, and the `odp_timer_to_u64()` and `odp_timer_pool_to_u64()`
APIs are now properly implemented. In addition, an issue with compiling the
timer routines on 32-bit systems using clang was resolved.

==== Scheduler fairness
The default scheduler has been improved to avoid starvation and increase
fairness when running with a limited number of threads or CPUs.

==== 128-bit atomics
The `-mcx16` compiler option is now properly identified and used to support
128-bit atomics on systems that support these operations. This leads to
increased efficiency in the implementation of both timers as well as other
atomic operations.

==== Use of hugepages
In systems that support multiple hugepage sizes, the default hugepage size is
now reported properly by the `odp_sys_huge_page_size()` API.

==== Coverity and Valgrind issue cleanup
Numerous issues identified by the Coverity scan tool have been cleaned up
and resolved, leading to improved robustness in the `odp-linux` reference
implementation. In addition, several memory leaks identified by the valgrind
tool have been fixed.

==== Validation test resource checks
The Traffic Manager validation test has certain sub-tests that require a
minimum of 2 CPUs to operate properly. These tests are now skipped with a
warning when run on uniprocessor systems.

=== Performance
Performance enhancements in the `odp-linux` reference implementation have been
made in packet processing, classification, and pktio, leading to increased
observed throughput and packet handling rates.

=== Examples
A new `l2fwd_simple` example has been added that does simple Layer 2 forwarding.

=== Documentation
==== Switch from AsciiDoc to AsciiDoctor
To get better formatting capabilities and future extensibility the ODP user
documentation system has been switched from http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] to
http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor]. There are a handful of notable changes as
a result of this. Those submitting documentation patches should be aware of
the following:

* `monospace font` is now indicated by demarking the text with backticks (`)
rather than plus signs (+).

* Callouts are now indicated by C++-style double slash comments (// &lt;1&gt;)
instead of C-style comments (/* &lt;1&gt; */). So, for example writing
-----------------------------------------------
[source,c]
----
...some great code deserving a callout // \&lt;1&gt;
----
&lt;1&gt; This is an example of a callout
-----------------------------------------------
yields:
----
...some great code deserving a callout // &lt;1&gt;
----
&lt;1&gt; This is an example of a callout

Note that this change only affects user documentation. Code documentation
still uses http://doxygen.org[Doxygen].

==== Image Cleanup
The images in the user guide have been trimmed to fit the page better. In
addition, many new images have been added to better illustrate ODP API usage.

==== Additional User Documentation for Monarch APIs
The *ODP User's Guide* has been updated to include new sections documenting
the use of the full Monarch packet APIs as well as the Timer APIs. In
addition, the crypto, classification, and traffic manager API documentation
has been improved to cover all of the latest Monarch features, and an
introductory section on overall ODP packet flow architecture has been added.

==== Helper Documentation
The ODP Helper library now has its own document that describes these additional
functions of use to ODP applications and validation tests.

==== Other documentation
The Process Guide, FAQ, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG files have been reworked
for the new AsciiDoctor structure, leading to a more uniform method of
presenting ODP support documentation. In addition, an option for generating
both a "pure" ODP API document that defines the APIs in their
implementation-independent forms as well as their implementation-dependent
forms for the `odp-linux` reference implementation is now available.

=== Known Issues
==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2301[Bug 2301]
The scheduler does not remove PKTIN queues following `odp_pktio_close()`

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2309[Bug 2309]
The timer validation tests have seen occasional failures when run on systems
containing a larger number of CPUs (typically 24 or more).

== OpenDataPlane (1.10.0.0)

=== New Features

* A focus has been made on improving the packaging support of ODP for
  distributions such as Debian.
* Improved creation of source tar ball and packaging scenarios moved to
  https://git.linaro.org/lng/odp-packaging.git
* Renamed libodp to libodp-linux
