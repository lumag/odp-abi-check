<pre class='wrap'>== OpenDataPlane (1.15.0.0)
=== New Features
ODP v1.15.0.0 continues the preview of Tiger Moth, introducing new APIs and
extensions, as well as numerous bug fixes and functional improvements.

==== Deprecation Framework
To permit smoother evolution of the ODP API specification, a deprecation
framework is introduced to permit controlled deprecation.

When an ODP API or defined struct parameter is deprecated, ODP validation
tests will be updated to no longer use that API and instead use the
replacement API. By default, attempts to compile with the older API/feature
will fail and applications wishing to move to the new ODP release should be
updated to use the replacement API. To permit evaluation of new ODP
releases in advance of such updating, however, ODP supports the `configure`
option `--enable-deprecated`, which makes the obsolete APIs visible again.

This feature will be used on a case-by-case basis and documented in the
release notes for each release that introduces replacement API(s). In general
the deprecated forms will not be maintained for more than a single release
cycle. After that they will no longer be present in the API specification and
the replacement forms must be used to compile with that level of the API
specification.

==== APIs
A number of new and refined APIs are introduced in crypto, packet parsing,
and queue configuration:

===== Crypto Enhancements
The ODP crypto APIs receive several enhancements in this release:

====== New Authentication Algorithms
Additional enumerations added for HMAC-SHA-1 and HMAC-SHA-512 authentication.

====== Deprecated Cipher/Authentication Algorithms
The following cipher/authentication algorithms have been deprecated in favor
of newer replacement algorithms:

* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES128_CBC` is replaced by `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_CBC`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES128_GCM` is replaced by `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_GCM`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_MD5_96` is replaced by `ODP_AUTH_ALG_MD5_HMAC`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA256_128` is replaced by `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA256_HMAC`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES128_GCM1 is replaced by `ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_GCM`

====== Deprecated Name for Crypto Parameter struct
`odp_crypto_op_params_t` is deprecated in favor of `odp_crypto_op_param_t`
for consistency with other ODP `param` structs.

====== Digest Length Session Parameter
`odp_crypto_session_param_t` adds the field `auth_digest_len` to permit
specification of the authentication digest length to be used for this
session. The `odp_crypto_auth_capability()` API returns the list of
supported digest lengths.

====== Additional Authentication Data (AAD)
The `odp_crypto_op_param_t` struct adds an optional pointer and length for
AAD information. This allows applications to specify AAD information from
the list of supported lengths provided by `odp_crypto_auth_capability()`.

===== Packet Range Data
The former `odp_crypto_data_range_t` type is deprecated and renamed to
`odp_packet_data_range_t` since it can be used to specify ranges for other
than crypto purposes.

===== Parser Configuration
Applications may now specify the maximum packet layer of interest. For
example, a router may not care about anything beyond ISO Layer 3 in packets.
This can be used by ODP implementations to control the depth of packet
parsing needed by the application and may allow greater efficiency,
especially in software implementations.

This is controlled by a new `odp_pktio_parser_layer_t` enum that is
part of the new `odp_pktio_parser_config_t` struct that is added to the
`odp_pktio_config_t` struct used by the `odp_pktio_config()` API. The
supported parser layers are also returned in this struct as part of the
`odp_pktio_capability_t` struct returned by the `odp_pktio_capability()` API.

===== Queue Size Parameter
The `odp_queue_capability_t` struct returned by the `odp_queue_capability()`
API is enhanced as follows:
* The `max_queues` field is now defined to return the maximum number of event
queues of any type.
* New sub-structs (`plain` and `sched`) are added that detail the `max_num` of
queues of that type supported as well as the new field `max_size` that
specifies the maximum number of elements that each queue of this type can
store. A value of zero for `max_num` indicates no fixed limit.

In addition, the `odp_queue_param_t` passed to `odp_queue_create()` now adds
a `size` field to allow applications to specify the minimum number of events
that this queue should be able to store. A value of zero specified requests that
the implementation default limits be used.

The ODP examples have been updated to show this configuration, for example,
the `l2fwd_simple` example does Layer 2 forwarding and hence doesn't need
packets to be parsed beyond Layer 2. So prior to opening an interface via
`odp_pktio_open()` the configuration processing now includes code of the form:
[source,c]
-----
odp_pktio_config_init(&amp;config);
config.parser.layer = ODP_PKTIO_PARSER_LAYER_L2;
odp_pktio_config(pktio, &amp;config);
-----
This serves as a hint to the ODP implementation that parsing beyond Layer 2
is not required on this interface.

===== Removal of `odp_time_to_u64()` API
The `odp_time_to_u64()` API is removed without deprecation in this release.
This is redundant since the `odp_time_to_ns()` API already returns a `uint64_t`
value for `odp_time_t` and can be used for the same purpose.

===== New `odp_sys_info_print()` API
For debugging / diagnostic use, the `odp_sys_info_print()` API is added.
This prints implementation defined information about the system and ODP
environment and may contain information about CPUs, memory, and other
hardware configuration.

=== Helpers
==== Linux Helpers
ODP helper functions fall into two categories: system-independent, and those
that rely on Linux. For backwards compatibility, these have been
reorganized into a new `helper/linux` directory that is installed only when
the `--enable-helper-linux` `configure` option is specified.

=== `odp-linux` Performance
==== Scheduler Improvements
The default scheduler is streamlined by using precomputed weight tables and
separated priority queues for different scheduling groups. This improves
both latency and scalability.

Also included in this change, the default number of scheduling groups is
lowered from 256 to 32, which experience has shown is sufficient for most
applications.

The scheduler fairness checks are also enhanced to avoid low priority event
starvation if `CONFIG_BURST_SIZE` is set to 1.

=== `odp_linux` Crypto Improvements
* Errors in implicit packet copy operations performed during crypto operation
are now handled properly.
* If `odp_crypto_session_create()` fails, proper cleanup is now performed to
avoid memory leaks.
* The auth digest len is now used when calculating HMACs, and full-length
digests are now added to supported SHA capabilities.
* Numerous crypto functions have been rewritten to use the OpenSSL `EVP_`
functions for improved efficiency and accuracy.

=== `odp-linux` Packet Improvements
* The packet parser now recognizes ICMPv6 packets in addition to ICMPv4.

=== `odp-linux` PktIO Improvements
* The `ethtool` and `socket` drivers add additional initializations to avoid
valgrind warnings.
* The `dpdk` driver is upgraded to DPDK 17.02 and is now also built with the
`--whole-archive` option, which means that PMDs no longer need to be linked
individually but are automatically included in builds that make use of DPDK
pktio support.

=== `odp-linux` Time Improvements
* The ODP Time APIs are now more efficiently handled by replacing the previous
Linux timespec with simple nanoseconds (ns) and using native hardware time
counters in x86 and ARM environments, when available.

=== `odp-linux` Traffic Manager Improvements
* Weighting is now handled properly when weight=1 is specified. Previously
this caused an overflow that distorted packet priorities.

=== Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements
==== Native Clang build on ARMv8
ARMv8 compilation now works properly when using the clang compiler.

==== Test Improvements
* The `odp_scheduling` performance test now handles dequeueing from
potentially concurrent queues properly.
* The traffic manager and time tests are now invoked via scripts to better
account for load-sensitivity when running regressions in CI environments.
* The l2fwd test now supports an additional parameter to specify the number
of scheduling groups to use in the test.
* The `odp_sched_latency` performance test now handles queue draining in
a robust manner.
* The crypto validation tests now properly check and validate message digests,
and include negative tests to verify that incorrect digests are properly
flagged. Note that this may expose omissions in other ODP implementations that
had previously passed this validation test.
* The crypto validation test now adds an explicit test for the NULL cipher,
as well as HMAC-SHA-1 and HMAC-SHA-512.
* The pktio_ipc test now properly cleans up only its own temp files.

==== Examples Improvements
* The `odp_generator` example now properly honors stop criteria based on
number of packets sent.
* The `odp_generator` example now properly flushes output messages
* The `odp_generator` example now supports port configuration.

== OpenDataPlane (1.14.0.0)
=== New Features
==== APIs
ODP v1.14.0.0 represents another preview of the Tiger Moth release series and
introduces new APIs and extensions.

===== Packet References
Packet references are a lightweight mechanism to allow applications to create
and manipulate different "views" of packets. These views consist of shared
bytes common to all references created on the same `odp_packet_t`, possibly
prefixed with unique headers that are private to each reference. Five new APIs
are introduced to enable this feature:

`odp_packet_ref_static()`::
Static references allow a single packet to have multiple "aliases", all of
which must be treated as read only. This is useful, for example, to retain
a reference to a packet being transmitted to support retransmit processing,
since the actual storage represented by a packet is not released until all
references to it have been freed via `odp_packet_free()` calls.

`odp_packet_ref()`::
Dynamic references differ from static references is that they permit the
individual `odp_packet_t` handles to have unique prefixes created via
`odp_packet_push_head()` or `odp_packet_extend_head()` calls. This can be
used, for example, to support multicasting packets to different destinations
by creating packets that consist of unique headers followed by a common shared
payload.

`odp_packet_ref_pkt()`::
Similar to `odp_packet_ref()`, but creates a dynamic reference by prepending a
preexisting header onto another packet.

`odp_packet_has_ref()`::
Returns a boolean indicator of whether a given `odp_packet_t` has other
references that share bytes with this packet.

`odp_packet_unshared_len()`::
Returns the number of unshared bytes accessible through a given `odp_packet_t`
handle. These are the only bytes that should be changed. All other bytes
in the packet should be treated as read only as they are shared with other
`odp_packet_t` handles.

Note that while the packet reference APIs and associated validation tests are
present in this release, the `odp-linux` reference implementation currently
implements references via packet copying. A zero-copy implementation of packet
references is planned to be part of the ODP v1.15.0.0 release.

==== ABI Specification
ODP has supported an Application Binary Interface (ABI) that permits
applications to be generated that are binary portable between select ODP
implementations. This is now formalized with the addition of structures that
permit ABI specifications to be defined that are shared between ODP
implementations. ODP provides a default ABI specification that is the same as
was provided before. This change means that additional ABIs may be defined
that are optimized to collections of platforms that share an Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA) and subscribe to them.

ABI specifications live in the `include/odp/arch/...` directory.

==== Instance Query (iQuery) Scheduler
Adding to the range of scheduler implementations supported by `odp-linux`, a
new scheduler, the instance query scheduler, is available by specifying
`--enable-schedule-iquery` at `configure` time.

This scheduler uses sparse bitmaps and offers scalability advantages when
dealing with large numbers of schedule queues. It otherwise offers performance
comparable to the default ODP scheduler implementation.

=== Helpers
Helpers have been reorganized to provide better independence from odp-linux
and to make them more useful with other ODP implementations. These
reorganizations are functionally transparent to ODP users but should
simplifying packaging and porting to other ODP implementations. This includes
adding the "umbrella" include file `odph_api.h` which can be used to include
all helper API definitions in an application.

=== Classifier Improvements
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now supports Pattern Matching Rules
(PMRs) for IPv6 addresses, inner and outer VLAN IDs, and inner and outer
Ethernet types.

=== Performance

==== Improved inlining for embedded applications
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now offers improved inlining support
for ODP APIs for applications compiled against ODP configured with the
`--enable-abi-compat=no` option, meaning they wish to forego binary
compatibility in exchange for improved performance. These applications remain
source portable to other ODP implementations.

==== Native `odp_cpu_pause()` for ARM processors
A native implementation of the `odp_cpu_pause()` API has been added for ARMv7
and ARMv8 processors.

==== New Microbenchmark
The `odp_packet_bench` microbenchmark application has been added to the
test performance directory to allow implementations to measure and calibrate
the performance of individual ODP packet APIs.

==== Ordered PktIO Test
The `odp_pktio_ordered` application has been added to the test performance
directory to provide stress-testing of packet ordering features of ODP.

=== Documentation
In addition to expanded documentation related to the new packet reference APIs,
a section on applicatin portability has been added that discusses the types
of portability offered by ODP and the tradeoffs that application writers should
consider when using ODP.

=== Bug Fixes

== OpenDataPlane (1.13.0.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.13.0.0 represents the initial preview of the Tiger Moth release series
and as such introduces new APIs and extensions that will be built on as this
release matures.

===== Crypto Parameter Normalization
Many ODP APIs take parameter structs of type `odp_xxx_param_t`. The crypto APIs,
for historical reasons, failed to follow this convention, using instead structs
of type `odp_crypto_params_t`, etc. These pluralized names are now deprecated
and their singular forms are introduced as the preferred names for these
structs. The old names are retained (for now) to ease migration, however
applications should convert to the new forms at their convenience as these
deprecated forms will be removed in the final Tiger Moth release.

The changes introduced for this include:

* `odp_crypto_op_params_t` =&gt; `odp_crypto_op_param_t`
* `odp_crypto_session_params_t` =&gt; `odp_crypto_session_param_t`

===== Crypto Decouple Key Length from Algorithm Specification
To provide a more flexible programming for handling all possible
key/digest/iv length combinations, the enums used for crypto specification
are split to decouple lengths from algorithm names. The only exception
is the SHA-2 family of hash routines, which have well-established naming
conventions that incorporate digest lengths (SHA-224, SHA-256, etc.)

Changes included with this restructure include:

* The `odp_crypto_capability_t` structure returned by the
`odp_crypto_capability()` API contains streamlined `odp_crypto_cipher_algos_t`
and `odp_crypto_auth_algos_t` substructures.
* A new `odp_crypto_cipher_capability()` API is added to return detailed
information about available cipher capabilities.
* A new `odp_crypto_auth_capability()` API is added to return detailed
information about available authentication capabilities.

===== `odp_crypto_session_param_init()` API
For completeness the `odp_crypto_session_param_init()` API is provided to
enable platform-independent initialization of the `odp_crypto_session_param_t`
structure used as input to `odp_crypto_session_create()`.

===== Bitfield and Byteorder Cleanup
The `ODP_BITFIELD_ORDER` define is added to the ODP specification to parallel
the existing `ODP_BYTEFIELD_ORDER` define. This will be set to the value
`ODP_BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` or `ODP_LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD`. This also addresses
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2402[Bug 2402], however since fixing
this required a small API change this was deferred until an API release
boundary.

===== Improved Name Argument Definitions in `odp_xxx_create()` Functions
The use of name arguments to the various resource creation APIs has
been standardized and documentation improved to clarify that unique
names are not required and that these may be specified as NULL for
anonymous resource creation. When non-unique resource names are used, it is
unspecified which of these are returned by a corresponding lookup API.

===== Pool Parameters for Packet Pools
The `odp_pool_param_t` structure adds the new field `max_len` to be used in
packet pools to advise the implementation of the maximum sized packet that
the application will allocate with a single `odp_packet_alloc()` call. This
may enable storage pool optimization.

===== Packet Clarifications
API documentation for `odp_packet_concat()` and `odp_packet_copy_from_pkt()`
is clarified to specify that the source and destination packets supplied to
these APIs should not refer to the same packet.

===== Packet Allocation Length Clarification
API documentation for `odp_packet_alloc()` is clarified to specify that
the supplied length for requested packet allocation should be greater
than zero.

===== Random API Changes
The APIs provided for working with random data have been revised. The third
parameter to `odp_random_data()` is now of type `odp_random_kind_t`, which is
an `enum` that is used to specify the quality of random data required. The
kinds of random data defined are:

`ODP_RANDOM_BASIC`::
No specific quality guarantees. This is assumed to be pseudo-random data
generated by software where speed of generation is more important than the
quality of the results.This is the lowest kind of random.

`ODP_RANDOM_CRYPTO`::
Random data suitable for use in cryptographic operations.

`ODP_RANDOM_TRUE`::
True random data generated from a hardware entropy source. This is the
highest kind of random.

The `odp_random_max_kind()` API is provided that returns the highest kind of
data available on this implementation. Requests for higher kinds than can be
supplied will fail.

For testing purposes it is often desirable to generate "random" sequences that
are repeatable. To support this use case, the `odp_random_test_data()` API is
introduced. This always returns BASIC random data but uses a user-supplied
64-byte seed parameter that is update for each call and can be used to
repeat the same sequence as needed.

===== Shared Memory Improvements
The `odp_shm_reserve()` API adds two new additional flags to support external
memory.

* `ODP_SHM_SINGLE_VA` guarantees that all ODP threads sharing this memory
will see the block at the same virtual address regardless of whether threads
are implemented as pthreads or processes and when `fork()` calls are made to
create them.

* `ODP_SHM_EXPORT` allows the memory block to be visible to other ODP
instances. Other ODP instances can retrieve this block via the new
`odp_shm_import()` API.

===== Classification Clarifications
The relationship between classification and queue configuration in the
`odp_pktin_queue_param_t` structure is clarified to emphasize that
classification subsumes queue-based I/O processing. This is an API
documentation change only.

=== Helpers
New helper APIs are introduced for IP table lookup support for longest prefix
matching as well as cuckoo hash tables. These are designed to provide analogs
to functions available in DPDK to assist applications being ported to ODP.

=== Performance Improvements
The odp-linux reference implementation includes a number of improvements to
make it more suitable for production use on platforms that rely on software
implementations of key ODP APIs.

==== Ring-based Pool Implementation
Storage pools used for buffers and packets are now implemented via lockless
ring structures that support burst mode read/writes to local caches for
significantly improved multi-core scalability

==== Buffer/Packet Header Optimizations
The layout of the structs used to support buffers and packets has been
optimized to reduce cache footprint and minimize path lengths in pack
