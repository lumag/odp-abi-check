<pre class='wrap'>== OpenDataPlane (1.14.0.0)
=== New Features
==== APIs
ODP v1.14.0.0 represents another preview of the Tiger Moth release series and
introduces new APIs and extensions.

===== Packet References
Packet references are a lightweight mechanism to allow applications to create
and manipulate different "views" of packets. These views consist of shared
bytes common to all references created on the same `odp_packet_t`, possibly
prefixed with unique headers that are private to each reference. Five new APIs
are introduced to enable this feature:

`odp_packet_ref_static()`::
Static references allow a single packet to have multiple "aliases", all of
which must be treated as read only. This is useful, for example, to retain
a reference to a packet being transmitted to support retransmit processing,
since the actual storage represented by a packet is not released until all
references to it have been freed via `odp_packet_free()` calls.

`odp_packet_ref()`::
Dynamic references differ from static references is that they permit the
individual `odp_packet_t` handles to have unique prefixes created via
`odp_packet_push_head()` or `odp_packet_extend_head()` calls. This can be
used, for example, to support multicasting packets to different destinations
by creating packets that consist of unique headers followed by a common shared
payload.

`odp_packet_ref_pkt()`::
Similar to `odp_packet_ref()`, but creates a dynamic reference by prepending a
preexisting header onto another packet.

`odp_packet_has_ref()`::
Returns a boolean indicator of whether a given `odp_packet_t` has other
references that share bytes with this packet.

`odp_packet_unshared_len()`::
Returns the number of unshared bytes accessible through a given `odp_packet_t`
handle. These are the only bytes that should be changed. All other bytes
in the packet should be treated as read only as they are shared with other
`odp_packet_t` handles.

Note that while the packet reference APIs and associated validation tests are
present in this release, the `odp-linux` reference implementation currently
implements references via packet copying. A zero-copy implementation of packet
references is planned to be part of the ODP v1.15.0.0 release.

==== ABI Specification
ODP has supported an Application Binary Interface (ABI) that permits
applications to be generated that are binary portable between select ODP
implementations. This is now formalized with the addition of structures that
permit ABI specifications to be defined that are shared between ODP
implementations. ODP provides a default ABI specification that is the same as
was provided before. This change means that additional ABIs may be defined
that are optimized to collections of platforms that share an Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA) and subscribe to them.

ABI specifications live in the `include/odp/arch/...` directory.

==== Instance Query (iQuery) Scheduler
Adding to the range of scheduler implementations supported by `odp-linux`, a
new scheduler, the instance query scheduler, is available by specifying
`--enable-schedule-iquery` at `configure` time.

This scheduler uses sparse bitmaps and offers scalability advantages when
dealing with large numbers of schedule queues. It otherwise offers performance
comparable to the default ODP scheduler implementation.

=== Helpers
Helpers have been reorganized to provide better independence from odp-linux
and to make them more useful with other ODP implementations. These
reorganizations are functionally transparent to ODP users but should
simplifying packaging and porting to other ODP implementations. This includes
adding the "umbrella" include file `odph_api.h` which can be used to include
all helper API definitions in an application.

=== Classifier Improvements
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now supports Pattern Matching Rules
(PMRs) for IPv6 addresses, inner and outer VLAN IDs, and inner and outer
Ethernet types.

=== Performance

==== Improved inlining for embedded applications
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now offers improved inlining support
for ODP APIs for applications compiled against ODP configured with the
`--enable-abi-compat=no` option, meaning they wish to forego binary
compatibility in exchange for improved performance. These applications remain
source portable to other ODP implementations.

==== Native `odp_cpu_pause()` for ARM processors
A native implementation of the `odp_cpu_pause()` API has been added for ARMv7
and ARMv8 processors.

==== New Microbenchmark
The `odp_packet_bench` microbenchmark application has been added to the
test performance directory to allow implementations to measure and calibrate
the performance of individual ODP packet APIs.

==== Ordered PktIO Test
The `odp_pktio_ordered` application has been added to the test performance
directory to provide stress-testing of packet ordering features of ODP.

=== Documentation
In addition to expanded documentation related to the new packet reference APIs,
a section on applicatin portability has been added that discusses the types
of portability offered by ODP and the tradeoffs that application writers should
consider when using ODP.

== OpenDataPlane (1.13.0.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.13.0.0 represents the initial preview of the Tiger Moth release series
and as such introduces new APIs and extensions that will be built on as this
release matures.

===== Crypto Parameter Normalization
Many ODP APIs take parameter structs of type `odp_xxx_param_t`. The crypto APIs,
for historical reasons, failed to follow this convention, using instead structs
of type `odp_crypto_params_t`, etc. These pluralized names are now deprecated
and their singular forms are introduced as the preferred names for these
structs. The old names are retained (for now) to ease migration, however
applications should convert to the new forms at their convenience as these
deprecated forms will be removed in the final Tiger Moth release.

The changes introduced for this include:

* `odp_crypto_op_params_t` =&gt; `odp_crypto_op_param_t`
* `odp_crypto_session_params_t` =&gt; `odp_crypto_session_param_t`

===== Crypto Decouple Key Length from Algorithm Specification
To provide a more flexible programming for handling all possible
key/digest/iv length combinations, the enums used for crypto specification
are split to decouple lengths from algorithm names. The only exception
is the SHA-2 family of hash routines, which have well-established naming
conventions that incorporate digest lengths (SHA-224, SHA-256, etc.)

Changes included with this restructure include:

* The `odp_crypto_capability_t` structure returned by the
`odp_crypto_capability()` API contains streamlined `odp_crypto_cipher_algos_t`
and `odp_crypto_auth_algos_t` substructures.
* A new `odp_crypto_cipher_capability()` API is added to return detailed
information about available cipher capabilities.
* A new `odp_crypto_auth_capability()` API is added to return detailed
information about available authentication capabilities.

===== `odp_crypto_session_param_init()` API
For completeness the `odp_crypto_session_param_init()` API is provided to
enable platform-independent initialization of the `odp_crypto_session_param_t`
structure used as input to `odp_crypto_session_create()`.

===== Bitfield and Byteorder Cleanup
The `ODP_BITFIELD_ORDER` define is added to the ODP specification to parallel
the existing `ODP_BYTEFIELD_ORDER` define. This will be set to the value
`ODP_BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` or `ODP_LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD`. This also addresses
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2402[Bug 2402], however since fixing
this required a small API change this was deferred until an API release
boundary.

===== Improved Name Argument Definitions in `odp_xxx_create()` Functions
The use of name arguments to the various resource creation APIs has
been standardized and documentation improved to clarify that unique
names are not required and that these may be specified as NULL for
anonymous resource creation. When non-unique resource names are used, it is
unspecified which of these are returned by a corresponding lookup API.

===== Pool Parameters for Packet Pools
The `odp_pool_param_t` structure adds the new field `max_len` to be used in
packet pools to advise the implementation of the maximum sized packet that
the application will allocate with a single `odp_packet_alloc()` call. This
may enable storage pool optimization.

===== Packet Clarifications
API documentation for `odp_packet_concat()` and `odp_packet_copy_from_pkt()`
is clarified to specify that the source and destination packets supplied to
these APIs should not refer to the same packet.

===== Packet Allocation Length Clarification
API documentation for `odp_packet_alloc()` is clarified to specify that
the supplied length for requested packet allocation should be greater
than zero.

===== Random API Changes
The APIs provided for working with random data have been revised. The third
parameter to `odp_random_data()` is now of type `odp_random_kind_t`, which is
an `enum` that is used to specify the quality of random data required. The
kinds of random data defined are:

`ODP_RANDOM_BASIC`::
No specific quality guarantees. This is assumed to be pseudo-random data
generated by software where speed of generation is more important than the
quality of the results.This is the lowest kind of random.

`ODP_RANDOM_CRYPTO`::
Random data suitable for use in cryptographic operations.

`ODP_RANDOM_TRUE`::
True random data generated from a hardware entropy source. This is the
highest kind of random.

The `odp_random_max_kind()` API is provided that returns the highest kind of
data available on this implementation. Requests for higher kinds than can be
supplied will fail.

For testing purposes it is often desirable to generate "random" sequences that
are repeatable. To support this use case, the `odp_random_test_data()` API is
introduced. This always returns BASIC random data but uses a user-supplied
64-byte seed parameter that is update for each call and can be used to
repeat the same sequence as needed.

===== Shared Memory Improvements
The `odp_shm_reserve()` API adds two new additional flags to support external
memory.

* `ODP_SHM_SINGLE_VA` guarantees that all ODP threads sharing this memory
will see the block at the same virtual address regardless of whether threads
are implemented as pthreads or processes and when `fork()` calls are made to
create them.

* `ODP_SHM_EXPORT` allows the memory block to be visible to other ODP
instances. Other ODP instances can retrieve this block via the new
`odp_shm_import()` API.

===== Classification Clarifications
The relationship between classification and queue configuration in the
`odp_pktin_queue_param_t` structure is clarified to emphasize that
classification subsumes queue-based I/O processing. This is an API
documentation change only.

=== Helpers
New helper APIs are introduced for IP table lookup support for longest prefix
matching as well as cuckoo hash tables. These are designed to provide analogs
to functions available in DPDK to assist applications being ported to ODP.

=== Performance Improvements
The odp-linux reference implementation includes a number of improvements to
make it more suitable for production use on platforms that rely on software
implementations of key ODP APIs.

==== Ring-based Pool Implementation
Storage pools used for buffers and packets are now implemented via lockless
ring structures that support burst mode read/writes to local caches for
significantly improved multi-core scalability

==== Buffer/Packet Header Optimizations
The layout of the structs used to support buffers and packets has been
optimized to reduce cache footprint and minimize path lengths in packet
manipulation.

==== Ordered Queue Improvements
The implementation of ordered queues has been streamlined and made more
scaleable in multi-core systems.

==== Packet Segmentation Improvements
The more advance segmentation capabilities present in the new ODP packet
implementation are used to streamline the implementation of APIs like
`odp_packet_concat()` and the head/tail extend/trunc APIs.

=== Bug Fixes

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2405[Bug 2405]
A number of "todos" were removed from the packet validation test suite.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2472[Bug 2472]
The CPU affinity is now correctly read from the cpuset.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2496[Bug 2496]
The PktIO validation test no longer uses invalid MAC addresses.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2512[Bug 2512]
The TCP checksum is now properly calculated for generated packets.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2798[Bug 2798]
The odp-linux reference implementation makes use of the OpenSSL library to
support the `odp_random_xxx()` APIs and some crypto operations. To support
OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.0, which are not thread safe, support is added
for OpenSSL locking callbacks that use ODP ticketlocks to provide OpenSSL thread
safety.

=== Known Issues

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2812[Bug 2812]
Make check fails on a single core VM in the process mode helper test.

== OpenDataPlane (1.12.0.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.12.0.0 has no API changes from previous v1.11.0 Monarch LTS. Version
is increased in current development release to make room for Monarch updates
numbers.

==== Application Binary Interface (ABI) Support
Support is added to enable ODP applications to be binary compatible across
different implementations of ODP sharing the same Instruction Set Architecture
(ISA). This support introduces a new `configure` option:

`no abi disable option`::
This is the default and specifies that the ODP library is to be built to
support ABI compatibility mode. In this mode ODP APIs are never inlined. ABI
compatibility ensures maximum application portability in cloud environments.

`--disable-abi-compat`::
Specify this option to enable the inlining of ODP APIs. This may result in
improved performance at the cost of ABI compatibility and is suitable for
applications running in embedded environments.

Note that ODP applications retain source code portability between ODP
implementations regardless of the ABI mode chosen. To move to a different ODP
application running on a different ISA, code need simply be recompiled against
that target ODP implementation.

==== SCTP Parsing Support
The ODP classifier adds support for recognizing Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) packets. The APIs for this were previously not implemented.

=== Packaging and Implementation Refinements

==== Remove dependency on Linux headers
ODP no longer has a dependency on Linux headers. This will help make the
odp-linux reference implementation more easily portable to non-Linux
environments.

==== Remove dependency on helpers
The odp-linux implementation has been made independent of the helper library
to avoid circular dependency issues with packaging. Helper functions may use
ODP APIs, however ODP implementations should not use helper functions.

==== Reorganization of `test` directory
The `test` directory has been reorganized to better support a unified approach
to ODP component testing. API tests now live in
`test/common_plat/validation/api` instead of the former
`test/validation`. With this change performance and validation tests, as well
as common and platform-specific tests can all be part of a unified test
hierarchy.

The resulting test tree now looks like:

.New `test` directory hierarchy

-----

==== Pools
The maximum number of pools that may be created in the odp-linux reference
implementation has been raised from 16 to 64.

==== Upgrade to DPDK 16.07
The DPDK pktio support in odp-linux has been upgraded to work with DPDK 16.07.
A number of miscellaneous fixes and performance improvements in this support
are also present.

==== PktIO TAP Interface Classifier Support
Packet I/O interfaces operating in TAP mode now can feed packets to the ODP
classifier the same as other pktio modes can do.

=== Performance Improvements

==== Burst-mode buffer allocation
The scheduler and pktio components have been reworked to use burst-mode
buffer allocation/deallocation, yielding a measurable performance gain in
almost all cases.

==== Burst-mode queue operations
ODP queues internally now attempt to use burst-mode enq/deq operations to
accelerate performance where applicable.

==== Ring-based Scheduler Priority Queues
The ODP scheduler has been enhanced to use ring-based priority queues, resulting
in significantly better scalability in many core environments.

==== GitHub Automation Support
ODP now supports the Travis framework needed to trigger CI automation in
conjunction with GitHub. This support is considered experimental for now.

=== Examples

==== New `l3fwd` Example
A new example application is provided that illustrates use
of ODP for simple Layer 3 forwarding across multiple interfaces.

=== Documentation

==== Pure API Documentation
ODP now generates "pure" (implementation independent) doxygen documentation in
addition to the specific documentation for the odp-linux implementation. The
pure version is applicable to any ODP implementation as it simply describes
the ODP API specification. Implementation-specific versions of this
documentation describe both the APIs as well as specifics concerning typedefs,
enums, etc. This should help clarify what aspects of ODP are platform
independent.

==== Clarify ODP Thread Definition
The definition of an ODP thread in odp-linux has been clarified to specify that
for this implementation ODP threads are Linux pthreads or Linux processes.
Currently threads as processes is considered experimental in odp-linux.

=== Bug Fixes
Numerous refinements have been incorporated to make
validation tests more robust in API coverage as well as correcting corner
cases in the implementation of many ODP APIs. Notable fixes include:

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316[Bug 2316]
`ODP_TIMEOUT_INVALID` is now defined consistently with other pool elements so
the restriction on using Pool 0 as a timer pool is removed.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310[Bug 2310]
The `odp_packet_copy()` API now correctly handles user areas between pools that
are configured with different sized per-packet user area definitions.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2571[Bug 2571]
Corrects the implementation of AES GCM decryption in the ODP crypto API.

=== Known Issues

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2309[Bug 2309]
The Timer validation test fails sporadically in environments with high core
counts.

== OpenDataPlane (1.11.0.0)
ODP v1.11.0 is the base tag and branch for the Monarch LTS (Long Term Support)
release of ODP.

=== New Features
==== APIs
As part of the final Monarch LTS API set, a minor change to the
`odp_tm_egress_t` struct was made to better reflect the capabilities of
SoC platforms targeting Monarch support. This change adds the boolean
`egress_fcn_supported` that indicates whether TM  systems support an egress
function. In addition, each TM system is now associated with a PktIO rather
than a PktOUT queue. This struct is input to the `odp_tm_create()` API and
output from the `odp_tm_find()` API.

==== Strict Priority (SP) Scheduler
Building on the modular scheduler framework introduced in v1.10.1.0, An
alternate Strict Priority (SP) scheduler is now available. The SP scheduler
is selected when ODP is configured with the `--enable_schedule_sp` option.

The SP scheduler is designed to favor low-latency processing of high priority
work at the expense of throughput. This is considered experimental code at
this point and should be treated as such by those wishing to use it.

=== Bug Fixes
==== Scheduler PktIO Cleanup
The scheduler now properly cleans up PktIOs operating in SCHEDULE mode following
`odp_pktio_close()` calls. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2301[Bug 2301].

==== Chksum Routine C++ conformance
The odph_chksum() helper routine is now C++ conformant. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2302[Bug 2302].

==== User Area Copying
The `odp_packet_copy()` API now copies the packet user area as part of its
processing and the packet validation test has been enhanced to verify that this
is done properly. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310[Bug 2310].

==== Use of Pool 0 as a Timeout Pool
The internal definition of `ODP_TIMEOUT_INVALID` was changed in `odp-linux` to
enable the use of Pool 0 as a timeout pool. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316[Bug 2316].

=== Packaging
==== libodphelper
To facilitate API tracking, `libodphelper.so` has been split out from
`libodp.so`.

==== Helper dependencies
To avoid circular dependencies that cause issues when packaging ODP as a
shared library, the `odp-linux` implementation no longer makes and use of
the ODP helper library.

=== Performance
Performance enhancements in the `odp-linux` reference implementation have been
made in PktIO routines and the packet classifier.

=== General Cleanup
General cleanup throughout has resulted in adding proper termination calls to
ODP examples as well as miscellaneous Doxygen corrections.  Additionally, the
`odp-linux` code base has been cleaned up by removing "To Dos" as well as
extraneous `#includes` for extra C headers and dependencies on linux headers
for improved portability.

=== Validation
==== Queue Capability Test
The Queue validation test now properly exercises the `odp_queue_capability()`
API and attempts to create the maximum reported number of supported queues.

==== Platform Tests
The platform-specific tests have been moved from `platform/linux-generic/test`
to `test/platform/linux-generc` so that all tests are now found under a
single `test` directory.

=== Examples
The ODP `examples` directory has been cleaned up and numerous corrections to
existing examples have been made to add proper termination paths, etc. In
addition, a new "hello world" example (`odp_hello.c`) has been added that
illustrates the basic startup and shutdown steps needed for all ODP
applications. As a simple stand-alone application is is also a good initial
build tests for new ODP implementations.
